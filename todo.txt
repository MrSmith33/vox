o dll linking
	- #dllimport("lz4.dll") attribute on externals
	- #dllimport("lz4.dll") attribute on module
		pros: only symbols from specific module will be searched in a dll
	- .def file passing
	+ .dll file passing
		cons: simple passing allows all module externals to be searched for in passed .dll/.def
		pros: --optname=modulename:.dll/.def allows for benefit of above options
	- custom .def-like format (binary, combine all libs description in a single file)
+ enum
	- enum with bigger than i32 values doesn't compile
	- autoincrementing enum member values
	- enum type
- constant folding << >> >>> shifts needs to know type of left operand to mask the shift size


[CLI]
- -run option
- -i option (compile all imported files)
- stats about LoC compiled, time per entity


[Testing]
- test escape sequences
- test all implicit conversions
- test parsing errors
- test all integer size code gen
- signed to unsigned should use casts
- test bools
- test constant folding of all operators
- test mismatched number of args/params to call/constructor
- test declarations that have cyclic dependency (compiler must detect them through AstNode.state)
- test all expressions that compile with error being used inside other expressions (semantic check must correctly assign error type and check it when necessary)
- make sure that `this` is being used outside methods
- test that sections get correct offsets in executable
- split struct tests


[Backend]
- implement _chkstk and call it at the start of functions with frame size > 1 page


[ABI]
+ separate ABI lowering pass for win64


[Error messages]
- in error on unexpected EOF show unterminated ([{ symbol


[Optimizations]
- optimize pointer arithmetic into lea
- optimize branches on constants. They can't be omitted in loop header, because value is behind phi function
- tail call


[Debug info]
- Propagate loc through instructions
- Implement pdb format write/read


[Linking / Static data / Globals]
- Absolute references need relocations emitted (ObjectSymbolRefKind.absolute64)
	CoffFlags.RELOCS_STRIPPED is set for now
	executables can work without relocations
	dlls require reloc table
	*- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dynamicbase-use-address-space-layout-randomization?view=vs-2019
	* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/8248
- First arrange globals by alignment for tighter packing, then fill sections with data.
- Perform full reachability analisys before codegen runs to not generate unused symbols (functions)
+ Do not emit zero inited globals, only track them. Important for executables.
+ Implement zero initialized data section (at the end of rw section)
+ globals need to be initialized
x globals need to have IrIndex to initializer and coexist with raw data initializer (like for strings), or use aggrecate constant that is optimized for byte arrays. Then produce actual bytes of data at machine code emission pass. This way backend can look at initializer.


[IR]
- Allocate argument stack slots for multiple calls from the same space (for structs copies that are passed by ptr)
- IrBuilder must prevent adding instructions from wrong instruction set
- inline instructions in IR for representing memory operands in x86 LIR
- IrIndex: small pointer type when basic type is store inline + pointer level for more than 1 indirection level
- stack layout per IrFunction (use alloca?)
x don't store self-reference arguments in phi functions (we cannot alter order of args now, must have same order as blockIndex.predecessors)
+ store virtual registers, phi functions with arguments in separate arenas
	vreg will shrink from 7 slots to 4 slots
	+ need array arena for IR with per-function slices
- make sure that blocks for splitting critical edges are inserted after successor
+ Remove IR instruction structs, use enum values directly in emitInstr
+ Automatically use zero initialization when possible
- Constants
	+ Zeroinitializer
	- Add constant kind that inits all elements of an array with the same value
	- expression constant (required for expressions involving link-time constants like global address)
	- pointer constants are represented as numeric constants which do not have type associated.
	  zeroinit however does have a type.
- Validate all instructions
+ use actual arrays for users instead of linked lists


[Register allocator]
+ Do liveness + RA together on each function
+ reg alloc performance regression 1.9s -> 6.2s (Probably due to not reusing liveness info) [fixed by reusing state across all functions]
+ store use arrays in liveness info
+ store fixed intervals separately from virtual register intervals while doing RA
+ reuse spill stack slot
- allow src operands to be stack slots
	- differentiate uses that require value in a register and ones that dont
	  phi uses do not require register location for example
- select optimal split position
- spill at definition if there are multiple spill points / spilled intervals detected.
- Use array for unhandled list
- Add special machine description for testing RA
- Write RA test suite
- Stack parameters need to have cached stack slot
- optimize multiple spills into single spill at definition
- For stack to stack moves in move solver we always spill scratch register. Check if there is free register available.
- Spilling into xmm registers
